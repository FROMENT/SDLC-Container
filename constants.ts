### The Importance of Minimal Base Images

The container base image is the foundation of your security posture. Standard OS images (like \`ubuntu:latest\` or \`node:latest\`) contain package managers, shells, and system libraries that are unnecessary for your application but useful for attackers.

#### Comparison: Standard vs. Minimal

| Feature | Standard (Debian/Ubuntu) | Minimal (Alpine) | Distroless (Google) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Size** | > 100MB | ~5MB | ~20MB |
| **Package Mgr** | apt/dpkg | apk | None |
| **Shell** | Bash/Sh | Sh | None |
| **CVE Count** | High | Low | Lowest |

### 📰 Docker Security Update: Hardened Images (DHI)

**Breaking News**: Docker has made **Docker Hardened Images (DHI)** free and open source for all developers.

#### The Philosophy: Transparency & Trust
DHI aims to fix the "black box" nature of some security vendors by providing a secure foundation built on trusted OSs like **Debian** and **Alpine**.
*   **SLSA Level 3 Provenance**: Verifiable build integrity for every image.
*   **Complete SBOMs**: A full, transparent bill of materials included by default.
*   **Distroless Runtime**: Drastically shrinks the attack surface.
*   **Public CVE Data**: Vulnerabilities are assessed transparently; no hidden or downgraded scores.

#### Enterprise Grade vs. Open Source
While the images are free, **DHI Enterprise** offers a **7-day SLA** for critical CVE remediation and a managed build service for customizing images (e.g., adding corporate certs) without breaking compliance.

#### AI-Assisted Migration
Docker is introducing an **AI assistant** to scan existing containers and automatically recommend or apply the equivalent Hardened Image, reducing the friction of migration.

#### Implementation Example

Using a multi-stage build to deploy a Go application on a generic static container:

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM golang:1.21 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp main.go

# Runtime Stage (Distroless)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian11
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /
CMD ["/myapp"]

### Secure by Design

Security cannot be "bolted on" at the end. It must be architected from the start using **Zero Trust** principles.

#### Key Architectural Patterns

1.  **Namespace Isolation**: Treat Namespaces as soft tenancy boundaries. Use \`ResourceQuotas\` and \`LimitRanges\` to prevent noisy neighbor attacks.
2.  **Least Privilege**: Apps should only talk to necessary services. Assume the network is hostile.
3.  **Identity Awareness**: Use Workload Identity (OIDC) instead of long-lived static credentials.

#### STRIDE Threat Modeling for Containers

*   **S**poofing: Can a rogue pod impersonate a legitimate service? (Solution: mTLS)
*   **T**ampering: Can the container image be modified? (Solution: Immutable tags & Signing)
*   **R**epudiation: Are logs persistent? (Solution: Centralized logging)
*   **I**nformation Disclosure: Are secrets exposed? (Solution: External Secrets/Vault)
*   **D**enial of Service: Can one pod crash the node? (Solution: Limits & Requests)
*   **E**levation of Privilege: Can a container escape to host? (Solution: no-new-privs, non-root)

### Designing for Governance & Verification

Before writing code, establish the "Contract" for your containers. This includes how they are identified (Labels) and how their security is verified (Testing Strategy).

#### 1. Kubernetes Labeling Standards
Labels are the primary grouping mechanism in K8s. A consistent taxonomy is vital for Network Policies, Reporting, and Automation.

**Recommended Standard Labels (kubernetes.io):**
\`\`\`yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: my-app
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: my-app-prod
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "1.2.0"
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: billing-system
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: helm
\`\`\`

**Security Labels:**
*   \`data-classification: restricted\` (Used by Policy engines to enforce encryption).
*   \`compliance: pci-dss\` (triggers specific audit logs).
*   \`owner: team-security\` (Contact point for incidents).

#### 2. Security Testing Strategy
Security testing must be automated to prevent **Regression** (re-introducing fixed vulnerabilities).

| Test Type | Phase | Tool Example | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linting** | Design/Dev | \`kube-linter\`, \`hadolint\` | Check YAML/Dockerfile syntax & best practices. |
| **Policy Unit Tests** | Design/Build | \`opa test\` | **Non-regression** for Policy-as-Code. Ensure a policy change doesn't accidentally allow root containers. |
| **SAST** | Build | \`semgrep\` | Find code flaws. |
| **DAST** | Staging | \`owasp-zap\` | Attack running app. |

#### 3. Designing Non-Regression
When a security bug is found:
1.  Fix the bug.
2.  Write a **Negative Test Case** (e.g., a "bad" manifest that *should* fail validation).
3.  Add it to the CI suite.

### Systematic Risk Analysis

Threat modeling is the process of identifying, enumerating, and prioritizing potential threats. We use the **STRIDE** methodology to systematically analyze container architectures.

#### STRIDE in Detail for Kubernetes

| Threat | Definition | Container Context | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S**poofing | Impersonating something or someone. | A rogue pod claims the IP of a DB service. | **mTLS** (Istio/Linkerd), Network Policies. |
| **T**ampering | Modifying data or code. | Injecting malware into a base image. | **Image Signing** (Cosign), Read-only Root FS. |
| **R**epudiation | Claiming not to have performed an action. | A developer \`kubectl delete\`s a deployment without logs. | **Audit Logs**, Remote logging (Fluentd/Splunk). |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Exposing information to unauthorized users. | Leaking secrets in ENV vars or logs. | **External Secrets**, Encryption at Rest. |
| **D**enial of Service | Denying service to valid users. | A container consumes 100% CPU, starving others. | **Resource Quotas**, LimitRanges. |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gaining capabilities without authorization. | Container escape to host (privilege escalation). | **Pod Security Standards** (Restricted), Seccomp. |

#### Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
To apply STRIDE effectively, create a DFD of your cluster:
1.  **External Entities**: Users, CI/CD systems.
2.  **Processes**: Pods, Deployments, Operators.
3.  **Data Stores**: Persistent Volumes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Databases.
4.  **Data Flows**: Network traffic (Ingress/Egress).
5.  **Trust Boundaries**: Namespace boundaries, Cluster perimeter.

*Apply STRIDE to every element crossing a Trust Boundary.*

For regulated industries (Finance, Healthcare, Gov), where code runs and where data lives is a legal requirement, not just technical.

\`\`\`

#### Encryption Standards
*   **At Rest**: Use KMS plugins to encrypt Secrets in etcd. Ensure Persistent Volumes (PVs) are encrypted by the storage provider.
*   **In Transit**: Enforce TLS 1.2+ everywhere. Use Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd) to transparently upgrade TCP to mTLS.

### Securing the Software Supply Chain

An attacker doesn't need to hack your production server if they can hack your build server.

### Hardening the Build Process

The build environment is often highly privileged (access to secrets, registries, source code).

#### Best Practices

1.  **Avoid Secrets in Layers**: Never run \`COPY id_rsa .\` or \`ENV PASSWORD=...\`. Use build-time secret mounting.
2.  **Pin Base Images**: Do not use \`:latest\`. Use SHA256 digests for immutability.

### One Dockerfile, Three Environments

Multi-stage builds are not just for shrinking images. They allow you to define your entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) — **Dev, Test/Recette, and Prod** — within a single file.

#### 1. "Début" (Development Stage)
In the development stage, we need hot-reloading, debuggers, and full SDKs. We target this stage locally.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Base Stage (Common dependencies)
FROM node:20-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Stage: Development
# Includes tools like nodemon and full devDependencies
FROM base AS dev
RUN npm install -g nodemon
COPY . .
CMD ["nodemon", "server.js"]
\`\`\`

#### 2. "Recette" (Testing Stage)
Before building the artifact, we run tests inside the container. If this stage fails, the image build stops.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Stage: Tester (Recette)
FROM base AS tester
COPY . .
# Run linting and unit tests inside the build process
RUN npm run lint
RUN npm run test
\`\`\`

#### 3. "Déploiement" (Production Stage)
Finally, we create the lean, secure artifact. We copy *only* what is needed from previous stages.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Stage: Production (Déploiement)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11 AS prod
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=base /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=base /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=base /app/server.js ./
CMD ["server.js"]
\`\`\`

#### Usage
*   **For Dev:** \`docker build --target dev -t myapp:dev .\`
*   **For CI/Recette:** \`docker build --target tester .\`
*   **For Prod:** \`docker build --target prod -t myapp:prod .\`

### Shift Left: Automated Security Testing

Detecting vulnerabilities during the Build phase is significantly cheaper and safer than finding them in Production.

#### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
**"White Box" Testing**: Analyzes source code for security flaws without running it.
*   **Detects**: SQL Injection, XSS, Buffer Overflows, Hardcoded Credentials.
*   **Tools**: SonarQube, CodeQL, Semgrep.

#### 2. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
**"Supply Chain" Testing**: Analyzes open-source libraries and frameworks imported by your code.
*   **Detects**: Known CVEs in \`node_modules\`, \`pip\`, \`go.mod\`.

2.  **Baseline**: Minimally restrictive policy which prevents known privilege escalations.

    shortDesc: 'External Secrets Operator, Vault, and CSI.',
    staticContent: `
### Managing Secrets at Scale

Native Kubernetes Secrets store data in \`etcd\` encoded in **base64**, which is not encryption. Anyone with API access can read them.

#### The "External" Pattern
Instead of storing secrets in Git (GitOps anti-pattern) or manually creating them, use an operator to sync from a dedicated Vault.

**External Secrets Operator (ESO)**:
1.  Connects to AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault.
2.  Polles for changes.
3.  Creates/Updates a native K8s \`Secret\` object for the pod to consume.

#### Best Practice: Volume Mounts
Mount secrets as files (tmpfs) rather than Environment Variables. Env vars can be leaked via crash dumps or \`proc\` file system.

### ConfigMaps vs Secrets

While often used together, they serve different purposes:

*   **ConfigMap**: Designed for non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., config files, environment variables). Stored in plain text in etcd.
*   **Secret**: Designed for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys). Stored as base64-encoded strings in etcd.

#### Kubernetes Secrets Best Practices

1.  **Encryption at Rest**: By default, secrets are stored unencrypted in etcd. Enable **Encryption Configuration** in Kubernetes to encrypt secrets at rest using a provider (like a KMS plugin).
2.  **RBAC**: Restrict \`get\`, \`list\`, and \`watch\` permissions on Secrets. Only specific controllers or operators should have broad access.
3.  **Immutable Secrets**: Use \`immutable: true\` for stable secrets to protect against accidental updates and improve performance.

### GitOps & Secrets Management

In GitOps, the git repository is the source of truth. However, **never commit raw Kubernetes Secrets to Git**.

#### Strategy 1: Encrypted Secrets in Git
Tools like **Sealed Secrets** or **SOPS** allow you to store encrypted data in Git, which is decrypted only inside the cluster.

*   **Bitnami Sealed Secrets**: Uses asymmetric encryption. Developers encrypt with a public key (\`kubeseal\`), and the cluster controller decrypts with a private key. Safe to commit the \`SealedSecret\` CRD.
*   **Mozilla SOPS**: Encrypts YAML values using cloud KMS (AWS/GCP/Azure) or PGP. Integrates seamlessly with Flux and ArgoCD.

#### Strategy 2: Reference External Secrets (ESO)
Don't store the secret in Git at all. Store a reference (manifest) that points to the actual secret in a Vault.

*   Commit an \`ExternalSecret\` custom resource to Git.
*   It contains the *pointer* (e.g., "fetch secret \`db-pass\` from AWS Secrets Manager").
*   The operator fetches the value and creates the Kubernetes Secret.
*   *Result*: Git contains no sensitive data, only configuration.

### The Deployment Gatekeeper

Admission Controllers intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server *before* persistence of the object, but *after* the request is authenticated and authorized.

#### OPA Gatekeeper vs Kyverno
*   **OPA Gatekeeper**: Uses **Rego**, a specialized query language. Extremely powerful and flexible.
*   **Kyverno**: Uses Kubernetes Native Policy (YAML). Easier to learn for K8s admins, but slightly less flexible than Rego.

#### 1. Disallow Root Containers (Rego)
This policy ensures no container runs as User ID 0 (root), mitigating container escape risks.

\`\`\`rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  not container.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
  msg := sprintf("Container '%v' must set runAsNonRoot to true.", [container.name])
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Enforce Image Provenance (Trusted Registry)
Ensure all images come from your trusted internal registry (e.g., \`registry.corp.com\`) to prevent pulling malicious public images.

\`\`\`rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  not startswith(container.image, "registry.corp.com/")
  msg := sprintf("Image '%v' comes from an untrusted registry.", [container.image])
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Require Ownership Labels
Mandate labels like \`cost-center\` or \`team\` for all Deployments to ensure accountability.

\`\`\`rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Deployment"
  not input.request.object.metadata.labels["team"]

### OpenShift Network Policies: The Cluster Firewall

By default, OpenShift (like stock Kubernetes) utilizes a **flat network** model. This means every Pod can communicate with every other Pod in the cluster, across all projects (namespaces), unless isolated by the CNI.

#### 🛑 The Risk: Unchecked East-West Traffic
"East-West" traffic refers to communication *inside* the cluster (Service-to-Service).
*   **Bad Practice**: A flat network where the \`Frontend\` can talk directly to the \`Database\`, but also to the \`Payment-Service\` and the \`Admin-Dashboard\`.
*   **Attack Scenario**: If the Frontend is compromised (e.g., via Log4Shell), the attacker has a direct line to probe the database or internal admin panels.

*(See the interactive visualization above)*

#### ✅ The Solution: Microsegmentation
We use \`NetworkPolicies\` to create a "Zero Trust" network inside the cluster.

**Step 1: The Default Deny (The "Firewall")**
Apply this policy to every Project (Namespace) to block all incoming traffic by default. This forces you to explicitly allow what is needed.

#### OpenShift Specifics (OVN-Kubernetes)
Modern OpenShift versions use **OVN-Kubernetes** as the default CNI.
*   **Performance**: OVN uses Open vSwitch, which is highly efficient for enforcing these ACLs.
*   **Visualization**: Use the **OpenShift Web Console > Topology** view. When you enable "Network Policy" overlay, you can visually see allowed traffic flows between components.
*   **Multi-Tenancy**: OpenShift offers a \`NetworkPolicy\` mode called \`MultiTenant\` (in older SDN) or strict isolation in OVN. Ensure your project isolation is enabled.

### Patterns for Observability & Debugging

In a "Secure by Design" environment, production containers are **immutable** and **minimal** (Distroless). They lack shells (\`/bin/sh\`), package managers, and debug tools. This makes them secure but hard to troubleshoot.

#### 1. The Sidecar Pattern (Implementation)
A sidecar is a secondary container in the same Pod. It shares the **Network Namespace** (localhost) and can share **Storage Volumes**.

**Example: Secure Log Shipping**
The application writes logs to a shared volume (never to stdout if sensitive, or strictly structured). The sidecar (Fluentd/Vector) reads, encrypts, and ships them.

\`\`\`yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-sidecar
spec:
  containers:
  # 1. Main Application
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app:1.0 (Distroless)
    volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log/app
  
  # 2. Sidecar (Log Shipper)
  - name: log-shipper
    image: fluentd:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log/app
      readOnly: true # Security: Sidecar cannot tamper with logs
  
  volumes:
  - name: logs
    emptyDir: {}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Debugging Distroless with Ephemeral Containers
Since you cannot run \`kubectl exec\` on a Distroless image (no shell), you must bring your own shell using **Ephemeral Containers**.

**Feature:** Allows you to add a container to a *running* Pod without restarting it.

**Step-by-Step Debugging:**

1.  **Inject the Debugger**: We attach a "Swiss Army Knife" image (like \`netshoot\`) to the target pod.
2.  **Target the Process Namespace**: Use \`--target\` to see the main container's processes (localhost).

\`\`\`bash
# The "Magic" Command
kubectl debug -it my-secure-pod \\
  --image=nicolaka/netshoot \\
  --target=main-app-container \\
  -- sh

# Inside the debug shell:
netstat -tulpn  # View ports open by the main app
ps aux          # View processes of the main app
tcpdump -i eth0 # Capture traffic
\`\`\`

#### 3. Profiling & Copying
Sometimes you need to analyze files (heap dumps) generated by the crashed app.

\`\`\`bash
# Create a copy of the pod with a debug container attached (for post-mortem)
kubectl debug my-pod -it --image=busybox --share-processes --copy-to=my-debugger-pod
\`\`\`

#### Security Implications
*   **RBAC**: Restrict the \`ephemeralcontainers\` subresource in Role/ClusterRole. Only senior SREs should have this permission.
*   **Policy**: Use Admission Controllers (Kyverno/OPA) to whitelist allowed debug images (e.g., allow \`netshoot\`, deny \`hacker-tool-kit\`).

Standard containers share the host Linux kernel. A kernel vulnerability (like Dirty Cow) allows container escape.

Falco monitors kernel system calls in real-time. It can alert on suspicious behavior that static analysis misses.

**Typical Alerts:**
*   A shell (\`bash\`) spawned in a production container.
*   Modification of \`/etc/passwd\`.
*   Outbound connection to a crypto-mining pool IP.
*   Reading sensitive files (certificates/keys).

### 📰 Mise à Jour Sécurité: Docker Hardened Images (DHI)

**Breaking News**: Docker a rendu les **Docker Hardened Images (DHI)** gratuites et open source pour tous les développeurs.

#### La Philosophie: Transparence & Confiance
DHI vise à corriger l'effet "boîte noire" de certains fournisseurs en offrant une fondation sécurisée basée sur des OS de confiance comme **Debian** et **Alpine**.
*   **Provenance SLSA Niveau 3**: Intégrité du build vérifiable pour chaque image.
*   **SBOMs Complets**: Une liste complète des composants (Bill of Materials) incluse par défaut.
*   **Runtime Distroless**: Réduit drastiquement la surface d'attaque.
*   **Données CVE Publiques**: Les vulnérabilités sont évaluées en toute transparence; pas de scores cachés ou dégradés.

#### Enterprise Grade vs. Open Source
Bien que les images soient gratuites, **DHI Enterprise** offre un **SLA de 7 jours** pour la correction des CVE critiques et un service de build géré pour la personnalisation des images (ex: ajout de certificats d'entreprise) sans briser la conformité.

#### Migration Assistée par IA
Docker introduit un **assistant IA** pour scanner les conteneurs existants et recommander ou appliquer automatiquement l'image durcie équivalente, réduisant la friction de migration.

#### Exemple d'Implémentation

Utilisation d'un build multi-stage pour déployer une application Go sur un conteneur statique générique :

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM golang:1.21 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp main.go

# Runtime Stage (Distroless)

### Secure by Design

La sécurité ne peut pas être "ajoutée" à la fin. Elle doit être architecturée dès le départ en utilisant les principes du **Zero Trust**.

#### Patterns d'Architecture Clés

1.  **Isolation par Namespace**: Traitez les Namespaces comme des frontières de location (soft tenancy). Utilisez \`ResourceQuotas\` et \`LimitRanges\` pour éviter les attaques de type "noisy neighbor".
2.  **Moindre Privilège**: Les apps ne doivent parler qu'aux services nécessaires. Supposez que le réseau est hostile.
3.  **Identité**: Utilisez Workload Identity (OIDC) au lieu de credentials statiques longue durée.

#### Threat Modeling STRIDE pour Conteneurs

*   **S**poofing (Usurpation): Un pod malveillant peut-il se faire passer pour un service légitime ? (Solution: mTLS)
*   **T**ampering (Modification): L'image du conteneur peut-elle être modifiée ? (Solution: Tags Immuables & Signing)
*   **R**epudiation (Répudiation): Les logs sont-ils persistants ? (Solution: Logging Centralisé)
*   **I**nformation Disclosure (Divulgation): Les secrets sont-ils exposés ? (Solution: External Secrets/Vault)
*   **D**enial of Service (Déni de Service): Un pod peut-il crasher le nœud ? (Solution: Limits & Requests)
*   **E**levation of Privilege (Élévation): Un conteneur peut-il s'échapper vers l'hôte ? (Solution: no-new-privs, non-root)

### Designer pour la Gouvernance & la Vérification

Avant d'écrire du code, établissez le "Contrat" pour vos conteneurs. Cela inclut leur identification (Labels) et la vérification de leur sécurité (Stratégie de Test).

#### 1. Standards de Labeling Kubernetes
Les labels sont le mécanisme principal de regroupement dans K8s. Une taxonomie cohérente est vitale pour les Network Policies, le Reporting et l'Automatisation.

**Labels Standards Recommandés (kubernetes.io):**
\`\`\`yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: my-app
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: my-app-prod
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "1.2.0"
    app.kubernetes.io/component: database
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: billing-system
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: helm
\`\`\`

**Labels de Sécurité:**
*   \`data-classification: restricted\` (Utilisé par les moteurs de Policy pour forcer le chiffrement).
*   \`compliance: pci-dss\` (déclenche des logs d'audit spécifiques).
*   \`owner: team-security\` (Point de contact pour les incidents).

#### 2. Stratégie de Test de Sécurité
Les tests de sécurité doivent être automatisés pour prévenir la **Régression** (réintroduction de vulnérabilités corrigées).

| Type de Test | Phase | Exemple d'Outil | Objectif |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linting** | Design/Dev | \`kube-linter\`, \`hadolint\` | Vérifier la syntaxe YAML/Dockerfile & best practices. |
| **Policy Unit Tests** | Design/Build | \`opa test\` | **Non-régression** pour le Policy-as-Code. S'assurer qu'un changement de politique n'autorise pas accidentellement les conteneurs root. |
| **SAST** | Build | \`semgrep\` | Trouver les failles dans le code. |
| **DAST** | Staging | \`owasp-zap\` | Attaquer l'application en cours d'exécution. |

#### 3. Designer la Non-Régression
Lorsqu'un bug de sécurité est trouvé :
1.  Corrigez le bug.
2.  Écrivez un **Cas de Test Négatif** (ex: un "mauvais" manifeste qui *devrait* échouer à la validation).
3.  Ajoutez-le à la suite CI.

### Analyse Systématique des Risques

Le threat modeling est le processus d'identification, d'énumération et de priorisation des menaces potentielles. Nous utilisons la méthodologie **STRIDE** pour analyser systématiquement les architectures de conteneurs.

#### STRIDE en Détail pour Kubernetes

| Menace | Définition | Contexte Conteneur | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S**poofing | Usurper une identité. | Un pod voyou réclame l'IP d'un service DB. | **mTLS** (Istio/Linkerd), Network Policies. |
| **T**ampering | Modifier des données ou du code. | Injection de malware dans une image de base. | **Image Signing** (Cosign), Read-only Root FS. |
| **R**epudiation | Nier avoir effectué une action. | Un développeur fait un \`kubectl delete\` sans logs. | **Audit Logs**, Remote logging (Fluentd/Splunk). |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Exposer des infos non autorisées. | Fuite de secrets dans les variables d'env ou les logs. | **External Secrets**, Chiffrement "At Rest". |
| **D**enial of Service | Déni de service. | Un conteneur consomme 100% du CPU. | **Resource Quotas**, LimitRanges. |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gain de capacités non autorisées. | Évasion de conteneur vers l'hôte. | **Pod Security Standards** (Restricted), Seccomp. |

#### Diagrammes de Flux de Données (DFD)
Pour appliquer STRIDE efficacement, créez un DFD de votre cluster :
1.  **Entités Externes**: Utilisateurs, systèmes CI/CD.
2.  **Processus**: Pods, Deployments, Operators.
3.  **Data Stores**: Persistent Volumes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Bases de données.
4.  **Flux de Données**: Trafic réseau (Ingress/Egress).
5.  **Frontières de Confiance**: Frontières de Namespace, périmètre du Cluster.

*Appliquez STRIDE à chaque élément traversant une Frontière de Confiance.*

#### Standards de Chiffrement
*   **At Rest**: Utilisez des plugins KMS pour chiffrer les Secrets dans etcd. Assurez-vous que les Persistent Volumes (PVs) sont chiffrés par le fournisseur de stockage.
*   **In Transit**: Forcez TLS 1.2+ partout. Utilisez un Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd) pour upgrader de façon transparente le TCP en mTLS.

### Un Dockerfile, Trois Environnements

Les builds multi-stage ne servent pas seulement à réduire la taille des images. Ils vous permettent de définir tout votre Cycle de Vie de Développement Logiciel (SDLC) — **Dev, Test/Recette, et Prod** — dans un seul fichier.

#### 1. "Début" (Stage de Développement)
Dans le stage de développement, nous avons besoin du hot-reloading, de debuggers et de SDKs complets. Nous ciblons ce stage localement.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Base Stage (Dépendances communes)
FROM node:20-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Stage: Development
# Inclut des outils comme nodemon et les devDependencies complètes
FROM base AS dev
RUN npm install -g nodemon
COPY . .
CMD ["nodemon", "server.js"]
\`\`\`

#### 2. "Recette" (Stage de Test)
Avant de construire l'artefact, nous exécutons les tests *dans* le conteneur. Si ce stage échoue, le build de l'image s'arrête.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Stage: Tester (Recette)
FROM base AS tester
COPY . .
# Exécuter le linting et les tests unitaires dans le processus de build
RUN npm run lint
RUN npm run test
\`\`\`

#### 3. "Déploiement" (Stage de Production)
Enfin, nous créons l'artefact léger et sécurisé. Nous ne copions *que* ce qui est nécessaire depuis les stages précédents.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Stage: Production (Déploiement)
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11 AS prod
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=base /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=base /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=base /app/server.js ./
CMD ["server.js"]
\`\`\`

#### Utilisation
*   **Pour le Dev:** \`docker build --target dev -t myapp:dev .\`
*   **Pour la CI/Recette:** \`docker build --target tester .\`
*   **Pour la Prod:** \`docker build --target prod -t myapp:prod .\`

#### 1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
**Test "Boîte Blanche"**: Analyse le code source pour trouver des failles de sécurité sans l'exécuter.
*   **Détecte**: Injections SQL, XSS, Buffer Overflows, Identifiants codés en dur.
*   **Outils**: SonarQube, CodeQL, Semgrep.

#### 2. Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
**Test "Supply Chain"**: Analyse les librairies open-source et frameworks importés par votre code.
*   **Détecte**: CVEs connues dans \`node_modules\`, \`pip\`, \`go.mod\`.
*   **Outils**: Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, Trivy.

### Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS)

Kubernetes a déprécié les \`PodSecurityPolicies\` (PSP) en faveur du contrôleur intégré **Pod Security Admission (PSA)**.

#### Les Trois Profils
1.  **Privileged**: Non restreint (Évitez de l'utiliser).
2.  **Baseline**: Politique minimalement restrictive qui empêche les escalades de privilèges connues.
3.  **Restricted**: Hautement restreint, suivant les meilleures pratiques de durcissement actuelles.

#### Application via Labels de Namespace
Vous pouvez appliquer ces standards simplement en labellisant votre namespace :

\`\`\`yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-secure-app
  labels:
    # Forcer le standard restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
    # Avertir sur les violations baseline
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: baseline

    shortDesc: 'External Secrets Operator, Vault et CSI.',
    staticContent: `
### Gérer les Secrets à l'Échelle

Les Secrets Kubernetes natifs stockent les données dans \`etcd\` encodées en **base64**, ce qui n'est pas du chiffrement. Quiconque a accès à l'API peut les lire.

#### Le Pattern "External"
Au lieu de stocker les secrets dans Git (anti-pattern GitOps) ou de les créer manuellement, utilisez un opérateur pour synchroniser depuis un Vault dédié.

**External Secrets Operator (ESO)**:
1.  Se connecte à AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault.
2.  Sonde les changements.
3.  Crée/Met à jour un objet \`Secret\` K8s natif pour que le pod le consomme.

#### Best Practice: Montages de Volume
Montez les secrets comme des fichiers (tmpfs) plutôt que comme Variables d'Environnement. Les variables d'env peuvent fuiter via les crash dumps ou le système de fichiers \`proc\`.

### ConfigMaps vs Secrets

Bien que souvent utilisés ensemble, ils servent des objectifs différents :

*   **ConfigMap**: Conçu pour les données de configuration non sensibles (ex: fichiers de config, variables d'env). Stocké en texte clair dans etcd.
*   **Secret**: Conçu pour les données sensibles (ex: mots de passe, tokens OAuth, clés SSH). Stocké en chaînes encodées base64 dans etcd.

#### Best Practices Secrets Kubernetes

1.  **Chiffrement At Rest**: Par défaut, les secrets sont stockés non chiffrés dans etcd. Activez l'**Encryption Configuration** dans Kubernetes pour chiffrer les secrets au repos en utilisant un provider (comme un plugin KMS).
2.  **RBAC**: Restreignez les permissions \`get\`, \`list\`, et \`watch\` sur les Secrets. Seuls des contrôleurs ou opérateurs spécifiques devraient avoir un accès large.
3.  **Secrets Immuables**: Utilisez \`immutable: true\` pour les secrets stables afin de protéger contre les mises à jour accidentelles et améliorer la performance.

### GitOps & Gestion des Secrets

En GitOps, le dépôt git est la source de vérité. Cependant, **ne committez jamais de Secrets Kubernetes bruts dans Git**.

#### Stratégie 1: Secrets Chiffrés dans Git
Des outils comme **Sealed Secrets** ou **SOPS** vous permettent de stocker des données chiffrées dans Git, qui ne sont déchiffrées qu'à l'intérieur du cluster.

*   **Bitnami Sealed Secrets**: Utilise le chiffrement asymétrique. Les développeurs chiffrent avec une clé publique (\`kubeseal\`), et le contrôleur du cluster déchiffre avec une clé privée. Sûr à committer (le CRD \`SealedSecret\`).
*   **Mozilla SOPS**: Chiffre les valeurs YAML en utilisant un Cloud KMS (AWS/GCP/Azure) ou PGP. S'intègre parfaitement avec Flux et ArgoCD.

#### Stratégie 2: Référencer des External Secrets (ESO)
Ne stockez pas le secret dans Git du tout. Stockez une référence (manifeste) qui pointe vers le vrai secret dans un Vault.

*   Committez une ressource custom \`ExternalSecret\` dans Git.
*   Elle contient le *pointeur* (ex: "récupérer le secret \`db-pass\` depuis AWS Secrets Manager").
*   L'opérateur récupère la valeur et crée le Secret Kubernetes.
*   *Résultat*: Git ne contient aucune donnée sensible, seulement de la configuration.

    staticContent: `
### Le Gatekeeper du Déploiement

Les Admission Controllers interceptent les requêtes vers l'API server Kubernetes *avant* la persistance de l'objet, mais *après* l'authentification et l'autorisation de la requête.

#### OPA Gatekeeper vs Kyverno
*   **OPA Gatekeeper**: Utilise **Rego**, un langage de requête spécialisé. Extrêmement puissant et flexible.
*   **Kyverno**: Utilise des politiques Kubernetes Native (YAML). Plus facile à apprendre pour les admins K8s, mais légèrement moins flexible que Rego.

#### 1. Interdire les Conteneurs Root (Rego)
Cette politique assure qu'aucun conteneur ne tourne en tant que User ID 0 (root), atténuant les risques d'évasion de conteneur.

\`\`\`rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  not container.securityContext.runAsNonRoot
  msg := sprintf("Container '%v' must set runAsNonRoot to true.", [container.name])
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Forcer la Provenance de l'Image (Trusted Registry)
Assurez-vous que toutes les images viennent de votre registre interne de confiance (ex: \`registry.corp.com\`) pour empêcher le pull d'images publiques malveillantes.

\`\`\`rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  container := input.request.object.spec.containers[_]
  not startswith(container.image, "registry.corp.com/")
  msg := sprintf("Image '%v' comes from an untrusted registry.", [container.image])
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Exiger des Labels de Propriété (Ownership)
Rendre obligatoire des labels comme \`cost-center\` ou \`team\` pour tous les Déploiements afin d'assurer la responsabilité.

\`\`\`rego
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Deployment"
  not input.request.object.metadata.labels["team"]
  msg := "Deployments must have a 'team' label."
}
\`\`\`

#### Shift Left: Tester avec Conftest
N'attendez pas que le cluster vous rejette. Testez les politiques dans votre pipeline CI/CD avec \`conftest\`.

\`\`\`bash
# Exécuter dans la CI avant helm install
conftest test -p policies/ deployment.yaml

    staticContent: `
### OpenShift Network Policies: Le Firewall du Cluster

Par défaut, OpenShift (comme Kubernetes stock) utilise un modèle de **réseau plat**. Cela signifie que chaque Pod peut communiquer avec tous les autres Pods du cluster, à travers tous les projets (namespaces), à moins d'être isolé par le CNI.

#### 🛑 Le Risque: Trafic Est-Ouest Non Contrôlé
Le trafic "Est-Ouest" fait référence à la communication *à l'intérieur* du cluster (Service-à-Service).
*   **Mauvaise Pratique**: Un réseau plat où le \`Frontend\` can parler directement à la \`Database\`, mais aussi au \`Payment-Service\` et à l'\`Admin-Dashboard\`.
*   **Scénario d'Attaque**: Si le Frontend est compromis (ex: via Log4Shell), l'attaquant a une ligne directe pour sonder la base de données ou les panneaux d'admin internes.

*(Voir la visualisation interactive ci-dessus)*

#### ✅ La Solution: Microsegmentation
Nous utilisons les \`NetworkPolicies\` pour créer un réseau "Zero Trust" à l'intérieur du cluster.

**Étape 1: Le Default Deny (Le "Pare-feu")**
Appliquez cette politique à chaque Projet (Namespace) pour bloquer tout le trafic entrant par défaut. Cela vous force à autoriser explicitement ce qui est nécessaire.

\`\`\`yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: default-deny-all
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  # - Egress (Optionnel, mais recommandé pour haute sécurité)
\`\`\`

**Étape 2: Autoriser le Trafic Spécifique (Le "Trou")**
N'autorisez *que* le Frontend à parler au Backend, et *uniquement* sur le port 8080.

\`\`\`yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-front-to-back
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
\`\`\`

#### Spécificités OpenShift (OVN-Kubernetes)
Les versions modernes d'OpenShift utilisent **OVN-Kubernetes** comme CNI par défaut.
*   **Performance**: OVN utilise Open vSwitch, qui est hautement efficace pour appliquer ces ACLs.
*   **Visualisation**: Utilisez la vue **OpenShift Web Console > Topology**. Quand vous activez l'overlay "Network Policy", vous pouvez voir visuellement les flux de trafic autorisés entre les composants.
*   **Multi-Tenancy**: OpenShift offre un mode \`NetworkPolicy\` appelé \`MultiTenant\` (dans l'ancien SDN) ou une isolation stricte dans OVN. Assurez-vous que l'isolation de projet est activée.

### Patterns pour l'Observabilité & le Debugging

Dans un environnement "Secure by Design", les conteneurs de production sont **immuables** et **minimaux** (Distroless). Ils n'ont pas de shell (\`/bin/sh\`), pas de gestionnaires de paquets, et pas d'outils de debug. Cela les rend sûrs mais difficiles à dépanner.

#### 1. Le Pattern Sidecar (Implémentation)
Un sidecar est un conteneur secondaire dans le même Pod. Il partage le **Namespace Réseau** (localhost) et peut partager des **Volumes de Stockage**.

**Exemple: Log Shipping Sécurisé**
L'application écrit des logs dans un volume partagé. Le sidecar (Fluentd/Vector) les lit, les chiffre et les expédie.

\`\`\`yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-with-sidecar
spec:
  containers:
  # 1. Application Principale
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app:1.0 (Distroless)
    volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log/app
  
  # 2. Sidecar (Log Shipper)
  - name: log-shipper
    image: fluentd:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log/app
      readOnly: true # Sécurité: Le sidecar ne peut pas altérer les logs
  
  volumes:
  - name: logs
    emptyDir: {}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Debugger du Distroless avec les Conteneurs Éphémères
Puisque vous ne pouvez pas faire de \`kubectl exec\` sur une image Distroless (pas de shell), vous devez apporter votre propre shell avec les **Conteneurs Éphémères**.

**Fonctionnalité:** Permet d'ajouter un conteneur à un Pod *en cours d'exécution* sans le redémarrer.

**Pas-à-Pas:**

1.  **Injecter le Debugger**: On attache une image "Couteau Suisse" (comme \`netshoot\`) au pod cible.
2.  **Cibler le Process Namespace**: Utilisez \`--target\` pour voir les processus du conteneur principal (localhost).

\`\`\`bash
# La Commande "Magique"
kubectl debug -it my-secure-pod \\
  --image=nicolaka/netshoot \\
  --target=main-app-container \\
  -- sh

# Dans le shell de debug :
netstat -tulpn  # Voir les ports ouverts par l'app principale
ps aux          # Voir les processus de l'app principale
tcpdump -i eth0 # Capturer le trafic
\`\`\`

#### 3. Profiling & Copie
Parfois, vous devez analyser des fichiers (heap dumps) générés par l'app crashée.

\`\`\`bash
# Créer une copie du pod avec un conteneur de debug attaché (pour post-mortem)
kubectl debug my-pod -it --image=busybox --share-processes --copy-to=my-debugger-pod
\`\`\`

#### Implications de Sécurité
*   **RBAC**: Restreignez la sous-ressource \`ephemeralcontainers\` dans les Role/ClusterRole. Seuls les SRE seniors devraient avoir cette permission.
*   **Politique**: Utilisez des Admission Controllers pour whitelister les images de debug autorisées (ex: autoriser \`netshoot\`, bloquer \`hacker-tool-kit\`).

### Briser le Modèle de Noyau Partagé

Les conteneurs standards partagent le noyau Linux de l'hôte. Une vulnérabilité noyau (comme Dirty Cow) permet l'évasion de conteneur.

#### Conteneurs Sandboxés
Pour les workloads à haut risque (exécutant du code non approuvé), utilisez une isolation plus forte :

*   **gVisor (Google)**: Un shim noyau en userspace. Intercepte les syscalls. Ajoute de l'overhead mais une grande sécurité.
*   **Kata Containers**: Exécute chaque pod dans une micro-VM légère. Isolation au niveau matériel.

**Alertes Typiques:**
*   Un shell (\`bash\`) lancé dans un conteneur de production.

*   Connexion sortante vers une IP de pool de crypto-mining.
*   Lecture de fichiers sensibles (certificats/clés).
